        <h2>Digital Junior Summer</h2>
        <p>Algebra Junior organizes educational and fun summer holidays for all elementary school students! This year as well, we have prepared digital workshops for children, focusing on solving various problems using technology, multimedia, digital design, and communication, as well as creating content in all multimedia and software formats. The workshops are held as part of the Digital Summer Camp in Crikvenica and the Digital Summer School in Zagreb, so we can hang out, have fun, and learn both at the seaside and on the mainland! Two different programs will be offered at the camp and school, intended for children from 1st to 8th grade. Depending on the chosen term, participants will go through either the 1st or 2nd program, and if attending a two-week programâ€”both. In the first program, our ninjas learn to be music managers, while in the second, they become journalists and creators of mass media information. Check the schedules, prices, and locations of the school and camp at the following link.</p>
